## Abstract

The EM algorithm is an iterative algorithm very often used to estimate Mixture Models via maximum likelihood. Since the vector of the initial parameters is so critical for the convergence of the algorithm to the best local maximum of the likelihood function, an efficient initialization is required. Our solution to this problem is an unsupervised initialization based on network science. By mapping time series to complex networks using as adjacency matrix the Markov Transition Field associated to the time series, we can connect observed points and discover communities between them. In this way, (i) the number of communities found in the network structure can be matched to the number of the Mixture Model components; (ii) the vector of initial parameters can be directly obtained by the membership of the data points to the discovered communities. An experiment conducted on financial times series with very different characteristics shows that
our approach produces significantly better results if compared to conventional methods of initialization, as K-means and Random, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.
